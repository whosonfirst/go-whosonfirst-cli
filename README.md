# go-whosonfirst-cli

## Important

This package is no longer maintained. You should use [sfomuseum/go-flags](whosonfirst/go-whosonfirst-cli) instead.

## Install

You will need to have both `Go` (specifically [version 1.12](https://golang.org/dl/) or higher because we're using [Go modules](https://github.com/golang/go/wiki/Modules)) and the `make` programs installed on your computer. Assuming you do just type:

```
make tools
```

All of this package's dependencies are bundled with the code in the `vendor` directory.
